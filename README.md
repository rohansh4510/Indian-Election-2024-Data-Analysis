# Indian-Election-2024-Data-Analysis
In this project data was scrapped Election commision of India website. Data was collected state wise and its preprocessing and cleaing was done by me statewise. Unnecessary columns were removed. At last when data cleaning was done data of all individual states was merged to make it into a whole country data.
Now this whole country data along with some sub tables and files is being transported into POWER BI for visualization and dashboard is creted.
**During EDA I found the insights such as:**
Seats Won By each party
Party With Most Trailing Count
Top 5 parties with most trailing count
Top 5 parties with most seats Won
Top 10 states with most constituency 
Top 10 states with least constituency
